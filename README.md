The application `kafka-producer` is a web api responsible for capture the client's message and send to the queue, and the `kafka-consumer` is listening the broker and consuming its data

## Getting Started
* Start the docker containers
  * `docker-compose up`

* Use the `rest.http` file to send a request to producer application
